      <description>Just need the configs? For SC head to TL;DR
A note on the update: If you followed the previous version of this guide, you no longer need HidGuardian! Also Joystick Gremlin no longer needs to run as an administrator.

      <description>Note: This is part 2 of a series. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already installed all the required tools, go check out part 1 first.
Just need the configs? go to the TL;DR

For example, you can configure it so with you press the trigger button on your left joystick, it presses the Shift key on your keyboard.</description>

      <description>Star Citizen Advanced Controls Configuration These configurations are based off my personal setup for Star Citizen and are outlined in a two part guide on this site. That being said there are a few requirements, and you can use my configurations as a starting point whether or not you have the same joystick setup.
Note: This was last updated for Star Citizen 3.17.2-PTU.8143480 and may or may not work with the current build</description>
